# Who's me you ask...(❁´◡`❁)
I’m still growing, but I genuinely enjoy cybersecurity. I like messing with systems, testing things, breaking stuff safely, and learning from every weird behavior I find..  
<br>

## 💻 Hands-On Experience  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity**: My favorite rabbit hole. Ethical hacking, breaking things safely, digging into logs, and figuring out how and why attacks actually work.  
- 🌐 **Networking & System Administration**: I enjoy defending networks, setting up and securing systems, and seeing how corporate environments keep everything running smoothly and safely.  
- 🖥️ **IT Support & Troubleshooting**: I’ve done enough troubleshooting to know half of IT is just “why is this thing behaving like this?” — plus getting myself dirty with goochy fans and being haunted by mysterious BIOS beeps at night. 
- 🤖 **Web Development & AI Coding**: Dabbled in HTML, CSS, a bit of JavaScript, and now experimenting with AI-assisted coding to build and tweak stuff faster — they call it VaaS (Vulnerability as a Service)… I call it the unpredictable predictability.  
- ⚙️ **Powershell**: Writing scripts to simplify my day-to-day on the computer, automate boring tasks, and just generally mess around with code until it actually does what I want.

## 🌱 Currently Focusing On  
- Deepening expertise in **cybersecurity tools & practices**
- **and binge watching anime**.
<br>

## 🤝 I Thrive In Environments Where I Can  
- ✅ Solve **complex security challenges** _not that hard tho' please_
- 🔧 Contribute to **resilient and innovative digital solutions** _Just to make life easier_
- 📚 Keep **learning and sharing knowledge** with whomever I find along the road, be warned. **改善**
